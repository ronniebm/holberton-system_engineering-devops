Command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

### **Challenge 01:** Print "hello world". Hint: There are many ways to print text on the command line, one way is with the 'echo' command. Try it below and good luck!.  
The solution was:
```
echo "hello world"
```
